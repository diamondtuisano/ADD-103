      <h3>Literature Analysis: Anne, Austen, Snicket</h3>
      <p><em>Anne of Green Gables</em> introduces us to the ever-imaginative Anne Shirley, whose optimism and creative flair challenge <strong>society’s</strong> expectations of young women in her time. The <strong>themes</strong> of belonging, imagination, and growth highlight the enduring power of individuality. Her stubborn streak, though sometimes at odds with convention, offers readers a reminder of <strong>morality</strong> shaped by kindness and resilience.</p>

      <p>In <em>Pride and Prejudice</em>, Jane Austen brings wit and razor-sharp insight into a world obsessed with class, marriage, and appearances. The <strong>themes</strong> of love and pride intersect with biting social commentary, revealing how <strong>society</strong> is often ruled by first impressions and prejudice. Its enduring <strong>morality</strong> lesson? True worth isn’t tied to wealth or title but to character, humility, and growth.</p>

      <p>Finally, <em>A Series of Unfortunate Events</em> takes readers on a delightfully grim ride through absurd tragedies. Lemony Snicket’s sardonic tone examines <strong>society</strong>’s failures to protect the innocent, weaving <strong>themes</strong> of resilience, family, and the absurdity of authority. Its dark humor forces readers to reflect on <strong>morality</strong>, suggesting that justice is often elusive, but wit and determination provide their own survival tools.</p>

      <p>Together, these works show how literature entertains while holding up mirrors to <strong>society’s</strong> values, challenges, and contradictions.</p>
