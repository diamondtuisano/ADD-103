      <h3>Media Analysis: Avatar, Parks and Rec, The Mummy</h3>
      <p><em>Avatar: The Last Airbender</em> may look like a children’s cartoon, but its layered storytelling makes it a masterclass in <strong>politics</strong> and <strong>culture</strong>. Nations built on elemental powers mirror real-world histories of colonialism, balance, and resistance. Its <strong>impact</strong> lies in making viewers—young and old—grapple with themes of war, peace, and identity while still laughing at Uncle Iroh’s tea obsession.</p>

      <p><em>Parks and Recreation</em> takes the chaotic world of small-town government and transforms it into a satire of bureaucracy. It’s politics served with waffles, proving that optimism and absurdity can coexist. What makes it brilliant is how it reframes <strong>culture</strong>—public service is less about policy and more about relationships, dedication, and sometimes battling raccoons. Its <strong>impact</strong> has been enduring, inspiring real-world positivity about civic engagement, even in the midst of dysfunction.</p>

      <p>Then there’s <em>The Mummy</em> (1999), a film that redefined the adventurous blockbuster. Its campy mix of horror, comedy, and romance builds a <strong>cultural</strong> artifact of its own—an action movie that doesn’t take itself too seriously yet still explores issues of greed, power, and history. Its <strong>impact</strong> is clear: Brendan Fraser became the internet’s hero, and audiences were reminded that fun, adventurous cinema doesn’t need to sacrifice heart.</p>
