      <h3>Introduction</h3>
      <p>Hello, my name is Diamond, and I proudly identify as a <strong>lifelong-learner</strong>. As a <strong>veteran</strong>, I’ve tackled more than a few challenges head-on, and now my current mission is conquering academia—armed with determination, caffeine, and maybe a slightly unhealthy obsession with to-do lists. When I’m not hitting the books, you’ll probably find me hitting the weights. Yes, I fully embrace my status as a self-proclaimed <strong>gym rat</strong>, convinced that squats build both character and quads.</p>

      <p>Outside the gym and classroom, I find joy in spending time with my family, who serve as my grounding force in this ever-busy world. I’m also passionate about dissecting stories, whether they’re told through novels, movies, or TV shows. To me, media is more than just entertainment—it’s a mirror of human behavior, culture, and creativity. Analyzing characters’ choices and untangling plot threads is my idea of a good time (yes, I know how that sounds).</p>

      <p>In short, I’m someone who enjoys balancing discipline with curiosity, structure with wit, and seriousness with a dash of humor. Whether in fitness, academics, or storytelling, I approach each challenge with energy, persistence, and a desire to keep growing.</p>
