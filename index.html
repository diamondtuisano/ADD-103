    Love can be...endless, a battlefield, people even save all of their love for one person. <br/>
Psychology touts it as a multidimentional emotion with layers of intimacy, commitment, and affection. <br/>
Beyond the basic <i>Webster's</i> definition of love and even Foreigner's wanting to know what love is, <br/>
let's start with why people thought there should be a day recognizing the importance of it.

    <h2>History</h2>
<p style="color:darkred; font-style:italic;">
    In Rome, there was once an Ancient fertility festival called <b>Lupercalia</b> in mid-February that was <br/>
intended to purify the city and encourage fertility. Our modern understanding of the origins come from St. <br/>
Valentine. In one iteration, the brave priest would marry couples in secret due to Emperor Claudius's decree <br/>
that the lack of marriage would make young men better soldiers. In theory, they would be more willing to go <br/>
to war and sacrifice their lives without the emotional attachment of a wife or child to come home to. In <br/>
another legend, St. Valentine sent a letter to his jailer's daughter signed, <br/>
</p>

<blockquote>
From your Valentine
</blockquote>

<p style="color:darkred; font-style:italic;">
    By the 1700-1800's it became customary to exchange various forms of affection; handmade tokens, jewelry, <br/>
    personal letters, and notes.

    <h3>"Love" & Capitalism</h3>
<p>
    Nothing says modern love like showing how much you love someone by the amount of money you spent on them.<br/>
By the 1840's, companies truly struck while the iron was hot, commodifying the idea of love with mass-producing<br/>
cards, jewelry, flowers, and chocolates expressing affection and advertising with newspapers, magazines, <br/>
radios, and television. Americans spent a record <b>$27.5 billion</b> on Valentine's Day, according to the <br/>
National Retail Federation. Based on data within the last 10 years, Valentine's Day actually ranks on the <br/>
lower end of the spectrum after the top six categories: winter holidays, back to college, back to school, <br/>
Father's Day, Mother's Day, and Easter.
